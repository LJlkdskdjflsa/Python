# Algorithm

## hanoi
the hanoi tower problem

## search
search elements in a list
contains:
- linear search
- binary search

## sort
sort elements in ascending or descending order
contains:
- low level (slower)
  - bubble sort
  - select_sort
  - insert_sort
  - insert_sort_binary_search(I added my self(not fully finished yet))
- high level (faster)
  - heap sort
  - quick sork
  - merge sort(python use in build-in function)

### high level sort
time complexity the three algorithm is O(n*log(n))

speed in normal situation:
quick sort < merge sort < heap sort

defect of each:
- quick sort: efficiently lower when extreme case(reverse)
- merge sort: need to use extra storage
- heap sort: slower
